# Exercise 2

Write a programm that returns a list of random integers between 0 and 15 for n elements.

Pass the number of elements as an argument to the class initialization.
Pass the min number as an argument to the class initialization.
Pass the max number as an argument to the class initialization.
Implement the method `generate_numbers` that will return a list of random numbers between min and max for n elements.
