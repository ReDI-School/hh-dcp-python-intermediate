# Exercise 1

Write a programm that will return the min, max and average of a list of numbers. 
Wrap the Code into a class called `NumberStats` and implement the following methods:
* min: returns the minimum number of the list
* max: returns the maximum number of the list
* average: returns the average of the list
* all: returns a dictionary with the keys 'min', 'max' and 'average' and the corresponding values

The list of numbers is the following:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
``` 

You can find a template for the class in the [lesson_4/exercise_1/main.py](lesson_4/exercise_1/main.py) file.
