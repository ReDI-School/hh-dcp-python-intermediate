# Exercise 3

Calculate the total of all numbers which ends with 5 in the range 0...1000 and print it to the console using string formatting (Format: "The total of all numbers in the range 0...1000 is x.")
Use for-loop and `range(start,stop,step)` function for it.
Use f-strings or str.format() function to format the string.

### Example
```python
total = 0

# put your code here

print(f"The total of all numbers in the range 0...1000 is {total}.") # Total: 50000.
```
