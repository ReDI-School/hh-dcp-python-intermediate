# Homework Exercise 3

* Iterate over the sentence and print only those words, which have even number of letters. Get rid of punctuation first, before processing the words.
* Use for-loop and str.split()
* Remove all punctuation marks (e.g. !;,.')() from the text and 
* print it to the console. 
* You can use the built-in library from python called string. 
* This library has a list of commonly used built-in punctuation characters string.punctuation. To replace the punctuation characters from specific string, you can use the `str.replace(old_character, new_character)` function.
Sentence:
