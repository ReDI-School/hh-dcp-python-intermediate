# Homework - Exercise 4

You have a list of numbers represented in one single string:

"2.5, -22, 1, 73.9, 34.99, 0, 4, 17, 95, 40, 8.0, 12, -64.2"

* Iterate over this numbers and collect numbers, which have NO reminder by dividing by 2 in one list (e.g. 4 / 2 = 2 and has no reminder, so 4 will be collected)
* Iterate over this numbers and collect numbers, which HAVE A reminder by dividing by 2 in another list (e.g. 5 / 2 = 2.5 and has reminder, so 5 will be collected)
* Print the collected numbers in float format as two comma-separated strings to the console (format like the origin list of numbers represented in one single string) 
* first string with list of numbers, wich have no reminder, and second string with list of numbers, wich have a reminder
* Do the same for division by 3
