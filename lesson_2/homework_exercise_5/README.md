# Homework Exercise 5

Create a list of prime numbers in the range from 0...120 and print it to the console as one string with spaces between numbers using string formatting (Format: "Prime numbers between 0 and 120 are: '2 3 5 ...'")

* Use for-loop and range() function for it
* Prime numbers: whole numbers greater than 1 and only divisible by 1 and by itself
* Use f-strings or str.format() function to format the string

## Example

```python
# put your code here
print(f"Prime numbers between 0 and 120 are: '{prime_numbers_str}'") # Prime numbers between 0 and 120 are: '2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113'
```
