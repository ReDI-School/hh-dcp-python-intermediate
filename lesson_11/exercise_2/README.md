# Exercise 2
From lesson 2, homework exercise 1, you create a program for some calculations. 
You need to add tests to it, ensuring it works as expected.
It may be required to refactor the code to make it testable.

You can find the code in the `main.py` file.

* Move the code into a function `incrase(my_list: str) -> str` so you can test it.
* Add a test for the function, ensuring it works as expected.
* Test the function with an empty list.
* Refactor the code if needed.
